Your order management system sometimes has a bug and does not capture the order_time - i.e., order_time is blank.
Write a query to output the order ids which faced this bug.

Your database is named 'Orders' and has the following columns

order_id (INT)
order_time (DOUBLE)
customer_id (VARCHAR)
customer_name (VARCHAR)
address_pincode (INT)
apartment_floor (INT)

Input:

/*Query to output the order ids which faced this bug. */

select order_id from orders 
where order_time is null ;


Output:

┌────────────┐
│  order_id  │
├────────────┤
│ 2304111242 │
│ 2304111245 │
└────────────┘
